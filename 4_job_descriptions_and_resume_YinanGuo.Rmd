## Libraries 
Load the following libraries, you may need to install a few!

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud2)
library(janitor)
tidytext, tm, tidyr, wordcloud, wordcloud2, readxl and pdftools
There is a bug in wordcloud2 which prevents it from knitting more than 1 wordcloud, so we want to install wordcloud2 using devtools from github using  devtools::install_github("gaospecial/wordcloud2"). Just do this once. if you don't have devtools installed, install it first then install wordcloud2 like this.

devtools::install_github("gaospecial/wordcloud2")

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud2)
library(janitor)
library(tm)
library(tidyr)
library(pdftools)
```



# Setup 

-------- 

Part 1. Analyze Jobs 

## 1. Import 

1. Create jobs dataframe by using read_excel() to read in your MSBA30-50Jobs.xlsx (after you've loaded it with jobs), you can get started by using the MSBA20JobDescription.xlsx file if you want. 
2. I recommend piping it to clean_names() to deal with column names 
3. Print the first 5 jobs to make sure your import works. 

```{r}
msbajd <- read_excel("data/MSBA20JobDescriptions.xlsx") %>%
  clean_names()
head(msbajd,5)
```


# Task 1 â€“ Job Description Term & Bigram Frequency Analysis 

--------

## Task 1.Create a table of term frequencies 

The following steps will help you make your  term_frequency table need to make your first wordcloud. 

0. make a vector called excludes <- this is just an exmaple c("key", "clients", "chicago")
1. pipe jobs into unnest_tokens(word, job_description)
2. pipe into anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word" = "word")) this will remove common words
3. pipe into filter(!word %in% excludes ) this will remove excluded words  
  - remove "key", "clients", "chicago" and any other words you think make sense
  
4. pipe into filter(!str_detect(word,"^\\d")) this will remove digits 
5. group_by(word) and summarize or use count()
6. arrange(desc(n)) 
7. create a term_frequency table 
8. finally, print out the the top 20 terms using top_n() or slice_max()


```{r}
excludes <-c("key", "clients", "chicago","work","job","working","ability","and","to","of","with","in","the","at","a","is","are","be","have","on","will","for","as","then","this","that","you","if","do","we","or","our","your")

msbajd_freq <- msbajd %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, job_description) %>%
  anti_join(get_stopwords(language="en")) %>%
  filter(!word %in% excludes) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(word,"^\\d")) %>% 
  group_by(word) %>%
  count(word, sort=TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

msbajd_freq %>%
  slice_max(n,n=20)
```

### Task 1a. 

Create a wordcloud with all of the terms, using wordcloud2()

```{r}
msbajd_freq %>%
  wordcloud2()
```

### Task 1b. 

Create a wordcloud for the terms that start with the letter "a" 

```{r}
msbajd_freq %>%
  filter(startsWith(word,'a')) %>%
  wordcloud2()
```

### Task 1c. 

Create a word cloud of companies 

```{r}
msbafirm_freq <- msbajd %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, firm) %>%
  anti_join(get_stopwords(language="en")) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(word,"^\\d")) %>% 
  group_by(word) %>%
  count(word, sort=TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

msbafirm_freq %>%
  wordcloud2()
```


### Task 1d. 

Create a word cloud of job titles. 

```{r}
msbajobs_freq <- msbajd %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, title) %>%
  anti_join(get_stopwords(language="en")) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(word,"^\\d")) %>% 
  group_by(word) %>%
  count(word, sort=TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

msbajobs_freq %>%
  wordcloud2()
```



# Task 2, Words after DATA 

Clearly "DATA" an important word so what words come after data? 

------

## Task 2.1 - Words AFTER "data" ... 

1. pipe jobs 
2. into: unnest_tokens(bigram, job_description, token = "ngrams", n = 2, n_min = 2), what does bigram do?
3. separate bigram into two words: separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")
4. filter for "data" filter(word1 == "data") 
5. remove junk words on word2, filter(!word2 %in% excludes ) this will remove excluded word
6. unite word 1 and 2 together into a bigram
7. group_by(bigram)
8. summarize(n=n())
9. arrange(desc(n))
10. save data_term_frequency 

11. print top 10 data + terms 

```{r}
msbajd %>%
  unnest_tokens(bigram, job_description, token = "ngrams", n = 2, n_min = 2) %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  filter(word1 == "data") %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% excludes ) %>%
  mutate(bigram = str_c( word1, word2, sep = " ")) %>%
  group_by(bigram) %>%
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) ->data_term_frequency

data_term_frequency %>%
  slice_max(n,n=10)

```

## Task 2.2 - Create a word cloud of data + term combinations

```{r}
data_term_frequency %>%
  wordcloud2()
```

## Task 2.3 - Create a bar chart of the top 15, data + term combinations

```{r}
data_term_frequency %>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%
  top_n(15) %>%
  ggplot(aes(reorder(bigram, n),n)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="top 15 data + term combinations ",
        x ="data + term combinations", 
        y = "times") 

```

# Task 4. Your Resume 

---------

## Task 4 - getting started 

1. save/print your resume as PDF, it needs to be PDF format for this to work.  
2. install pdftools and load the library(pdftools)
3. use pdf_text to read your resume into a table. for example here's how i read my resume:  

resume <- pdf_text("/Users/mikames/Downloads/Michael Ames Resume_CurrentJan2019.pdf")
  
> note: this makes a character vector of your resume, we need to tidy it up and get it into a table. 
  
```{r}
resume <- pdf_text("data/YinanGuo-Resume.pdf")
```
  
## Task 4.2 - Parse your resume, filter out the common words, digits, and any excludes 
Your resume is now a character vector, you'll need to perform the following 
1. as_tibble(resume) will convert it to a data frame 
2. parse text into words, using unnest_tokens(word, value)
3. remove words you want to exclude 
4. remove numbers
5. group by words and count the words up. to make a resume_word_freq table.  

```{r}
resume %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, value) %>%
  anti_join(get_stopwords(language="en")) %>%
  filter(!word %in% excludes) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(word,"^\\d")) %>% 
  filter(!word %in% c("ca","b","c","guo","guoy221","san","diego","beijing","china","london","mar","may","aug","seu","jan","sep","apr","jul","jun","oct")) %>%
  group_by(word) %>%
  count(word, sort=TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) ->resume_word_freq
resume_word_freq

#filter for technology_word
resume_tech_word_freq <-
  resume_word_freq %>%
  filter(word %in% technology_words ) 
resume_tech_word_freq
```

## Task 4.3 - Create a word cloud of the remaining words in your resume

```{r}
resume_word_freq %>%
  wordcloud2()
```

## Task 4.4 filter for technology_words and technology_bigrams 

to do this you'll need to Bigram Freq. your resume, hen filter for technology_bigrams 

###  Task 4.4 Steps: Bigram Freq. your resume, filter for technology_bigrams  

1. as_tibble(resume) pipe into 
2. unnest_tokens(word, value, token = "ngrams", n = 2, n_min = 2) to make bigrams 
3. filter(word %in% technology_bigram ) for specific bigrams 
4. group_by(word) 
5. summarize(n=n()) 
6.  arrange(desc(n)) 
7.  make a resume_bigram_freq


```{r}
resume %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, value, token = "ngrams", n = 2, n_min = 2) %>%
  filter(word %in% technology_bigram ) %>%
  group_by(word) %>%
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) ->resume_bigram_freq

resume_bigram_freq
```

### 4.4 finally SMASH resume_word_freq & resume_bigram_freq together 

1. use bind_rows() to do this. 


```{r}
resume_term_frequency <-
  bind_rows(list(resume_tech_word_freq,resume_bigram_freq))
resume_term_frequency 
```

### TASK 4.4a - make a bar chart of combined technolgy term frequencies

```{r}
resume_term_frequency %>%
  ggplot(aes(reorder(word, n),n)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="combined technolgy term frequencies  ",
        x ="Resume Terms ", 
        y = "times")
```


### TASK 4.4b - make a wordcloud of combined technolgy term frequencies

```{r}
resume_term_frequency %>%
  wordcloud2()
```

## Task 5 â€“ Compare resume jobs. 

5.1	What terms do your resume and jobs data have in common? That is, compare your resume's terms to the terms found in the job descriptions. 
```{r}
myjd <- read_excel("data/My20JobDescriptions_YinanGuo.xlsx") %>%
  clean_names()

myjd_freq <- myjd %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, job_description) %>%
  anti_join(get_stopwords(language="en")) %>%
  filter(!word %in% excludes) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(word,"^\\d")) %>% 
  group_by(word) %>%
  count(word, sort=TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
myjd_freq

resume_word_freq %>%
  filter(word %in% myjd_freq$word) %>%
  select(word)
```

5.2	Based on the job's terms, what terms are missing from your resume? Make a table of terms missing from your resume but found in your job descriptions. 
```{r}
myjd_freq %>%
  filter(!word %in% resume_word_freq$word) %>%
  select(word)
```

5.3	What tech-skills does your resume and jobs have in common?
```{r}
#resume_tech_word_freq is tech words within resume
myjd_freq %>%
  filter(word %in% resume_tech_word_freq$word) %>%
  select(word)
```

5.4	Based on the job's tech-skills what skills are missing from your resume? 

```{r}
myjd_freq %>%
  filter(word %in% technology_words) %>%
  filter(!word %in% resume_tech_word_freq$word) %>%
  select(word)
```

#Questions in instruction Word file but not in this Rmd:
â€¢	What are the top 10 key words that your jobs found vs. the MSBA20 job description file? 
â€¢	What are the top 5 technology terms that you found vs the MSBA20 job description file? 

```{r}
msbajd_freq %>% slice_max(n,n=10)
myjd_freq %>% slice_max(n,n=10)

tech_term_freq %>% slice_max(n,n=5)
myjd_tech_term_freq <-
  myjd_freq %>%
  filter(word %in% technology_words) 
myjd_tech_term_freq %>% slice_max(n,n=5)
```
